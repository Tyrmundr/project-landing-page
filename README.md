# project-landing-page
CSS project creating a web-page based on a specific design  

NOTE: The hero text is mostly made-up and not a true representation of Japan. In fact, I have only a little knowledge of it and anything I mentioned there (yet).  

What I assume I'll learn/practice:  
- flexbox
- using CSS selectors / rules
- hover effects, transitions and image scaling
- using pseudocode  

What I plan to do:
- plan via pseudocode
- type everything to build muscle-memory
- google if needed  

What I achieved/added:  
- googled  
- learned about using icons, hover effects, positioning, images  
- realised it's a lot of work to gather content  
- learned it's better to plan and remove, than to not plan and clutter the code
